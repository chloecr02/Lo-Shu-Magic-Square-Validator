# Lo-Shu-Magic-Square-Validator
Developed a program to validate a 3x3 grid as a Lo Shu Magic Square using arrays, loops, and logic-based validation.  

#### Pseudocode
Start Program  
  
Ask user to enter 3 numbers for row 1 and column 1-3 (1-9)  
Ask user to enter 3 numbers for row 2 and column 1-3 (1-9)  
Ask user to enter 3 numbers for row 3 and column 1-3 (1-9)  
Display the numbers entered in a 3x3 grid format  
If the grid forms a magic square  
    Display the message "This is a Lo Shu magic square."  
or Else (if the numbers don’t match)  
    Display the message "This is not a Lo Shu magic square."  
If the program isn’t a Lo Shu magic square,  
Ask the user if they want to try again (y/n)  
If user selects y,  
Run the program again  
Until the user chooses 'n' or 'N'  
  
End Program
